# Facial expression recognition

In this project I developed an AI model capable of identifying when a person is happy, sad, surprised, angry, afraid or with a neutral expression.
The template will show the expression of the person generating a video.

The other files required for training the neural network and for testing the model can be found at the link:

Just unzip it inside the directory of this project.
